# next-js-example

## introduction

this is a demo using the [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)

the `content.md` file contains some basic markdown content to test the **remark table of contents** plugin

in the `index.js` you will find all the code of this example, it's just a little setup and I only pass 1 option to remark-table-of-contents which is `mdx: false` because it is not MDX content but pure markdown that we use here

## install the dependencies

use the following command to install the dependencies (node_modules):

`npm i`

## dev (local) server

to start the example, use your terminal and then go into the root of this example, then run the following command:

`npm run start`

then check out your terminal as the console log inside of the code will output the result on the command line
